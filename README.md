# IDEATION
Since this was going to be a quick app to work under a time crunch, I thought nothing better than a simple designed card based Angular app. This actually became kind of a project 3 model for the card system in particular. The idea to display Bond Cars was actually from my love of 007 movies and in particular the cars he drives.

# Design
Actually my design came from no where in particular. I actually just wanted to style the site similar to an Aston Martin simple, eloquent, and yet you know it is designed for speed.
