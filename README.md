# IDEATION
Since this was going to be a quick app to work under a time crunch, I thought nothing better than a simple designed card based Angular app. This actually became kind of a project 3 model for the card system in particular. The idea to display Bond Cars was actually from my love of 007 movies and in particular the cars he drives.

# Design
Actually my design came from no website in particular. I actually just wanted to style the site similar to an Aston Martin simple, eloquent, and yet you know it is designed for speed.

# USER STORY
The user if they like all the Bond cars from any movie they would just go to the sight to view all of the different cars throughout the films history.
If they are watching a new movie (any movie after Spectre) they could just add a new car and add a link to the car for the picture. It would be in the DB for everyone to see!
